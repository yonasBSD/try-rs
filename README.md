**try-rs** is a CLI tool designed to manage the chaos of temporary projects. Instead of cluttering your Desktop or `/tmp` with `test1`, `new-test`, and `final-test`, `try-rs` organizes them into date-prefixed directories, offering a robust TUI (Terminal User Interface) to create, navigate, and clean up your experiments.

## 💡 Inspiration

This project is a Rust port and re-imagination of the excellent [try](https://github.com/tobi/try) tool by **Tobi Lütke**.

While the original is a lightweight Ruby script, **try-rs** aims to bring the same philosophy, "Your experiments deserve a home", but with the performance, type safety, and modern TUI capabilities (using [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui)) of the Rust ecosystem.

## 🤔 Why try-rs?

| Feature         | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🏎️ Blazing Fast** | Built in Rust, it's compiled to a native binary. No more waiting for a script interpreter to start up. |
| **🖼️ Rich TUI**     | A modern Ratatui interface makes browsing and managing projects a breeze.                               |
| **✅ Type Safe**    | Say goodbye to runtime errors. Rust's strict compiler catches them before they become a problem.        |
| **Git-Aware**   | Clones repos with a single command, automatically naming them.                                          |

## ✨ Features

* **Fuzzy Search:** Instantly find old experiments using a smart fuzzy matching algorithm.
* **Auto-Dating:** Creates directories like `2025-12-17-rust-test` automatically.
* **Git Integration:** Paste a GitHub/GitLab URL, and it will auto-clone it into a dated folder.
    * `try-rs https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui` → clones to `.../2025-12-17-ratatui`
* **Visual Indicators:** Automatically detects and marks Git repositories with an icon () in the list.
* **Theming:** Fully customizable UI colors via config file (comes with **Catppuccin Mocha** as default).
* **Terminal UI:** A beautiful TUI built with Ratatui to browse your projects.
* **Safe Deletion:** Delete old experiments directly from the UI (`Ctrl+D`) with a confirmation popup.
* **Configurable:** Supports `XDG Base Directory` specification (`~/.config/try-rs/config.toml`).

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

* Rust & Cargo installed.
* A shell (Fish, Zsh, Bash).
* A **Nerd Font** installed (required for icons like  and 🦀).

### Building from source

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/tassiovirginio/try-rs.git](https://github.com/tassiovirginio/try-rs)
cd try-rs
cargo install --path . --bin try-rs
```

### Cargo install try-rs
```bash
cargo install try-rs
```

### Install in Archlinux
```bash
yay -S try-rs-bin
```

⚙️ Configuration

1. Setup the Shell Integration

Since try-rs needs to change your shell's current directory, it requires a small wrapper function.

🐟 Fish Shell (Recommended)

```bash
try-rs --setup fish
```

(Optional) Create an abbreviation:

```
abbr --add try try-rs
```

🐚 Zsh

```bash
try-rs --setup zsh
```

🐚 Bash

```bash
try-rs --setup bash
```


2. Config File
By default, experiments are stored in `~/work/tries`. You can customize the path and the UI colors (themes). To change this, create `~/.config/try-rs/config.toml`:

```toml
# ~/.config/try-rs/config.toml
tries_path = "~/Development/playground"

[colors]
title_try = "Magenta"
title_rs = "White"
search_box = "Green"
list_date = "Blue"
list_highlight_bg = "Magenta"
list_highlight_fg = "Black"
help_text = "DarkGray"
status_message = "Yellow"
popup_bg = "DarkGray"
popup_text = "LightRed"
```



🚀 Usage

Simply type try-rs (or your alias) in your terminal.
